# Some of my projects
...mainly those, which include some nice graphics.

## A Nostalgic Particle Tracker
Good old times.

## Radiological treatment planning system in MATLAB
This is an implementation of a 2D treatment planning system with all
major components such as radiological depth calculation, dose distribution
calculations and fluence map optimization. [Want more?](https://github.com/matthaeusheer/treatment-planner)

## Creating a Semantic Building Map
Given the input stream from the volumetric mapping library
[voxblox](https://github.com/ethz-asl/voxblox), I created a semantic map
of a building and it's entry points along with uncertainty measures for
each entry point.

## Parallelizing 2D Convex Hull Finding Algorithms
We implemented several algorithms that compute convex hulls and
parallelized the heck out of them. Amongst others, Quickhull, Jarvis,
Graham, Chan and combinations thereof. [Code](https://github.com/matthaeusheer/dphpc-project) here.

## Making Evolutionary Optimization Algorithms Go Fast
[This](https://github.com/matthaeusheer/fastcode) project was all about
implementing some nice animal-inspired
optimization algorithms and get the last bit of performance out of them.
C is your friend.

## Planetary Collisions and How the Solar System Formed
Those where the questions I investigated on during my Bachelors thesis.

## SPH Simulations
Fun little project implementing Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics
simulations and some underlying tree datastructures.
