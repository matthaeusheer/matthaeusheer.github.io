I am a Masters Student at [University of Zurich](https://www.uzh.ch/de.html) and [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/de.html) in Biological and Medical Physics. I like coding, climbing and people.  

These are some of my projects.
## Radiological Treatment Planning System
My implementation of a 2D treatment planning system including all
major components such as radiological depth calculation, dose distribution
calculations and fluence map optimization using
constrained Gradient Descent optimization.

## Creating a Semantic Building Map
How would a [fire-fighting drone](https://www.mbzirc.com/challenge/2020)
know how to enter a building and put those fires down?
In my work at the [Autonomous Systems Lab](https://asl.ethz.ch/) at
ETH Zurich I attempted to provide answers.

## A RRT (Rapidly-Exploring Random Trees)-based Path Planner
Some Monte-Carlo sampling action to get from A to B.

## PID Controller
A real classic. If you want to learn how it works - code it up yourself!
Or check out [my implementation](https://github.com/matthaeusheer/playground/tree/main/pid_contoller)
of a PID controller test suite here.

## A 3D OpenGL Renderer
A fast [3D renderer](https://github.com/matthaeusheer/sph-gl) to visualize SPH point cloud data from planetary collisions in pure OpenGL and C++.

## Parallelizing 2D Convex Hull Finding Algorithms
Implementations and benchmarks of several convex hull computation
algorithms with some neat OpenMP parallelization going on.
Algorithms include Quickhull, Jarvis,
Graham, Chan and combinations thereof.

## Making Evolutionary Optimization Algorithms Go Fast
This project about implementing various [Meta-Heuristic Optimiztaion](http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Metaheuristic_Optimization)
algorithms and squeezing the last bit of performance out of them.
