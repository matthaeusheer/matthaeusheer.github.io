# Some of my projects

## A Nostalgic Particle Tracker
Good old times.

## Radiological Treatment Planning System
This is an implementation of a 2D treatment planning system with all
major components such as radiological depth calculation, dose distribution
calculations and fluence map optimization. [Want more GIF's?](https://github.com/matthaeusheer/treatment-planner)

## Creating a Semantic Building Map
How would a [fire-fighting drone](https://www.mbzirc.com/challenge/2020) know how to enter a building and put
those fires down? I might be able help with that.

## Parallelizing 2D Convex Hull Finding Algorithms
We implemented several algorithms that compute convex hulls and
parallelized the heck out of them. Amongst others, Quickhull, Jarvis,
Graham, Chan and combinations thereof. [Code](https://github.com/matthaeusheer/dphpc-project) here.

## Making Evolutionary Optimization Algorithms Go Fast
[This](https://github.com/matthaeusheer/fastcode) project was all about
implementing some nice animal-inspired
optimization algorithms and get the last bit of performance out of them.
C is your best friend.

## 3D Vision and the Hololens
Want to explore a site? Someone needs to tell you where you haven't
been yet!

## Planetary Collisions and How the Solar System Formed
Those where the questions I investigated on during my Bachelors thesis.

## SPH Simulations
Fun little project implementing [Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoothed-particle_hydrodynamics#:~:text=Smoothed%2Dparticle%20hydrodynamics%20(SPH),1977%2C%20initially%20for%20astrophysical%20problems.)
simulations and some underlying tree datastructures.

## Finding People in the Wild
This drone is capable of deciding who needs help down there!
